# PantryVision

## 🧠 Overview
**PantryVision** is an intelligent kitchen assistant that helps users automatically track their groceries, suggest recipes based on available ingredients, and minimize food waste. It uses **computer vision** to recognize items in your fridge or pantry and integrates with a **database and AI agent** to provide personalized recipe and shopping suggestions.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of PantryVision is to create a smart, hands-free inventory management system for the kitchen. It aims to:
- Detect and track grocery items using AI-powered video processing that observes what users place into or remove from the fridge, updating the inventory automatically.
- Store and manage user inventory data to create better recommendations.
- Suggest recipes based on preferences, fitness goals, allergies, and available ingredients.
- Notify users of upcoming expiration dates to reduce waste.

## ⚙️ Core Technologies
In the planning stage, I may use:
- **Python** — Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV / YOLO / TensorFlow** — For object detection and image recognition.
- **SQLite / Firebase** — For storing inventory and user data.
- **LangChain / OpenAI API** — For recipe generation and intelligent meal planning.
- **FastAPI or Flask** — Backend for handling API calls and database interaction.
- **React Native (optional)** — For a mobile interface or companion app.

## 🧩 Key Features (Prototype Goals)
1. **Image Recognition:** Detect items inside the fridge using a connected camera.
2. **Inventory Tracking:** Log items into a structured database with timestamps.
3. **Recipe Generation:** Suggest recipes based on current ingredients.
4. **Expiration Monitoring:** Estimate or extract expiration dates using barcode or OCR.
5. **User Notifications:** Alert users when items are expiring or missing for a recipe.

## 🧰 Development Setup
- Start in **Python IDE** (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter) for prototyping.
- Use **Google Colab** for AI model training and testing.
- Later, deploy to a **cloud platform** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for scalability.

## 🔐 License
This project is licensed under the **MIT License**, allowing others to use, modify, and distribute it with attribution.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- Integrate receipt or barcode scanning for easier item input.
- Develop an IoT-compatible fridge camera mount for continuous monitoring.
- Implement cross-device syncing (mobile app + web dashboard).
- Introduce sustainability analytics (food waste tracking, carbon footprint).
